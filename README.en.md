> Windows deployment baselines, operations tooling, and a community-plugin validation catalog for DeepSeek Harness (DSH).

This repository captures DSH Desktop/Core/Copilot deployments, diagnostics, recovery procedures, and integrations verified on real Windows systems. It does not redistribute Desktop, Core, or third-party plugins. Exact locks and acceptance contracts define the supported baseline.

## Current supported baseline

[`deployments/windows-copilot.lock.json`](deployments/windows-copilot.lock.json) is authoritative. Its current verification date is **2026-09-03**.

| Component | Locked version |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek Harness Desktop | 0.10.2 |
| Controlled `@deepseek-ai/dsh` CLI | fork 0.1.1-rc.2 |
| Desktop-selected `@deepseek-ai/dsh` runtime | fork 0.1.1-rc.2 or Desktop-managed wrapper 0.1.2-alpha.4 with inner DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 |
| `dsh-github-copilot` | 0.3.0-cloga.15 |
| Desktop internal plugins | seven official Profile links plus one non-bundled 0.6.7 panel placeholder under `resources\node_modules` |
| Optional Web overlays (not baseline requirements) | `dsh-playwright-host@0.1.2`, `dsh-cron@0.4.1` |

A project appearing in a README, catalog, or historical incident does **not** mean it belongs to this baseline. The default branch and deployment lock are this repository's publication channel; this repository does not redistribute Desktop/Core/plugin binaries. A lock update defines the reviewed target baseline, not proof that a particular machine already ran `-Apply`; default check mode reports unapplied drift truthfully.

## Start here

| Goal | Guide |
|---|---|
| Check or install the locked Windows + Copilot baseline | [`docs/local-core-desktop-copilot.md`](docs/local-core-desktop-copilot.md) |
| Check versions, configuration, services, models, and replay patches | [`docs/windows-replay-tooling.md`](docs/windows-replay-tooling.md) |
| Diagnose installation problems and apply targeted repairs | [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) |
| Choose or evaluate a community plugin | [`docs/plugins/choosing-a-plugin.md`](docs/plugins/choosing-a-plugin.md) |
| Understand plugin validation levels | [`docs/plugins/plugin-validation.md`](docs/plugins/plugin-validation.md) |
| Evaluate Computer Use and browser automation | [`docs/plugins/computer-use.md`](docs/plugins/computer-use.md) |
| Operate the optional Session scheduler | [`docs/plugins/scheduling.md`](docs/plugins/scheduling.md) |
| Check or install the optional Copilot, Cron, and Playwright suite together | [`docs/plugins/optional-companion-suite.md`](docs/plugins/optional-companion-suite.md) |
| Read the machine-readable plugin catalog | [`catalog/plugins.json`](catalog/plugins.json) |
| Track improvements, ownership, PR status, and evidence | [`docs/improvement-portfolio.md`](docs/improvement-portfolio.md) |
| Contribute changes or report security issues privately | [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) / [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) |

## Do not confuse three kinds of validation

1. **Plugin catalog:** [`catalog/plugins.json`](catalog/plugins.json) records discovery, source review, import compatibility, composition mount, functional smoke, deployment validation, and locked-baseline levels.
2. **Compatibility check:** `tools/dsh-compat-check.mjs` analyzes installed community-plugin dependencies and probes the host entry import. Passing means **import-compatible**, not functionally proven or secure.
3. **Deployment lock:** `deployments/*.lock.json` pins exact versions, commits, artifact hashes, installation, acceptance, and rollback. This defines support.

Evaluate community plugins in a disposable Profile first:

```powershell
node tools\dsh-compat-check.mjs <profile> --probe=<package>
node tools\validate-plugin-catalog.mjs
```

Then use an isolated `DSH_HOME` to verify Cordis activation, tool registration, cleanup, and a representative function before promoting its catalog level. Do not use the maintained `web` Profile for a first-time trial.

## Tool map

| Category | Primary tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | `tools/install-windows-copilot.ps1` | Check by default; install the locked baseline only with explicit `-Apply` |
| Bootstrap | `tools/enable-copilot-search-vision.ps1` (historical compatibility name) | Install the direct Copilot plugin, select hosted search, and report UI sign-in requirements; no vision fallback is installed |
| Optional suite | `tools/install-optional-companion-suite.ps1` | Check by default; explicitly `-Apply` the independently versioned Copilot, Cron, and Playwright Bundles together without restarting the Host |
| Replay and acceptance | `tools/dsh-replay.ps1` | Self-check, strict-marker patches, dry-run, backup, and rollback |
| Plugin compatibility | `tools/dsh-compat-check.mjs` | Static dependency inventory and real host import probe |
| Plugin catalog | `tools/validate-plugin-catalog.mjs` | Validate catalog constraints, evidence references, and baseline consistency |
| Recovery | `tools/dsh-doctor.mjs` | Installation health, repair, isolated boot, and plugin inventory |
| Session safety | `tools/check-session-duplicates.ps1`, `tools/dsh-move-session.mjs` | Duplicate-ID checks and atomic migration |
| Agent-native operations | `tools/dsh-dev-tools/` | In-session status, patch, build, upgrade, and doctor tools |

## Documentation map

- **Deployment and integration:** `local-core-desktop-copilot.md`, `vision-dual-channel.md` (now the native DSH attachment and `read_image` architecture)
- **Plugin governance and optional overlays:** `docs/plugins/`, including `computer-use.md`, `scheduling.md`, and `better-sidebar.md`, plus `catalog/`
- **Diagnostics and migration:** `tools/README.md`, `windows-replay-tooling.md`, `session-move-workspace-groups.md`
- **Incidents and platform issues:** `startup-60s-timeout.md`, `powershell-5.1-pitfalls.md`, `github-network.md`
- **Maintenance status:** `improvement-portfolio.md`, `windows-replay-tooling.md`

## Security rules

- Load credentials only from a user-designated trusted source into the current process or DSH credential service. Prefer one centralized `.env`; never print, copy between repositories, or commit values.
- Start community MCP servers read-only; enable side effects only when explicitly required.
- Computer Use, real-browser control, and vision plugins may expose screens, cookies, messages, passwords, and native applications. Recommendation policy must remain separate from functional validation.
- Back up runtime/configuration changes, keep patches idempotent, and document rollback.
- Before any Desktop/Host restart, query live Sessions; require direct acknowledgement before interrupting any running Session.
- Preserve and attest Desktop's seven official Profile links and non-bundled panel placeholder; do not replace them with guessed registry packages.

## Project relationships and maintenance

This repository does not redistribute Desktop, Core, or the Copilot plugin. It pins reviewed versions and commits and orchestrates installation, migration, acceptance, and rollback. The `cloga/*` repositories are controlled deployment forks, so this table describes default-branch capability and the current deployment pin rather than internal PR workflow state.

| Project | Deployment responsibility | Current relationship |
|---|---|---|
| [`dsh-tauri-desk/deepseek-harness-desktop`](https://github.com/dsh-tauri-desk/deepseek-harness-desktop) | Official Windows shell, lifecycle, and seven Profile plugins plus one shipped placeholder | Current lock uses official 0.10.2 |
| [`cloga/deepseek-harness`](https://github.com/cloga/deepseek-harness) | Local Core, model/vision metadata, receipt installation, sandbox policy, strict pi-ai OAuth JSON record normalization, and per-model API routes | Deployment pin `a772dbbd` |
| [`cloga/dsh-github-copilot`](https://github.com/cloga/dsh-github-copilot) | A companion to built-in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai`: sign-in UI that clears one-time device-code notices after success, Host-only grant normalization, account-aware `models`/strict-mode leaf reconciliation, Copilot-scoped Tool Schema filtering, Responses/Anthropic inline search, and Responses-only `ctx.web` search. The plugin preserves unowned existing-profile fields; the Windows deployment removes legacy connection references. No second adapter, gateway, or ACP. | Source `4e09519f`, merge `473b8aa1`, immutable Release `0.3.0-cloga.15` |
| [`cloga/dsh-windows-ops`](https://github.com/cloga/dsh-windows-ops) | Exact lock, check-first installer, migration, acceptance, and rollback | Default branch maintains the Windows + Copilot deployment baseline |

The historical ACP subagent practice remains in
[`docs/copilot-acp-subagent.md`](docs/copilot-acp-subagent.md), but it is a
separate optional integration and not part of the `dsh-github-copilot`
unified main-agent model path.

“All-in-one” means one DSH plugin reusing the built-in `llm-pi-ai` services. It
does **not** mean an embedded gateway: there is no local gateway process, port
7777, pasted GitHub token, placeholder API key, or separate search plugin.

[`docs/improvement-portfolio.md`](docs/improvement-portfolio.md) is the single status index for ownership, external-upstream status, and validation evidence. Before publishing or upgrading, follow the deployment lock and compatibility matrix rather than mixing versions from README strings.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11;
- Node `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` for the locked baseline;
- any baseline change must update the lock, fixtures, tests, and explanatory guide together.

The community catalog intentionally includes experimental and historical projects. Only entries marked `baseline` and matching a deployment lock are part of the currently supported configuration.
